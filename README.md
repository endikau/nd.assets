# nd.assets

Static front-end assets for EnDiKaU sites bundled as an npm package. The package ships everything under `dist/` (CSS, JS helpers, SCSS sources, vendored dependencies, fonts, and images).

## Install from npmjs
- Install (public): `npm install @endikau/nd_assets@latest`
- If the package is private, add to your `~/.npmrc` (or project-local `.npmrc`):
  ```
  //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_NPM_TOKEN
